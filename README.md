# TailWind CSS Guides

This repository includes some simple but important Tailwind and CSS studies.
On Chrome, remember to click `F12` to open the `dev console` and check the `html` rendered with `tailwind properties`.

Check the [`tailwind documentation`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), it's very well done.

If you already understand CSS it's a quick jump into start using tailwind to cut time in the dev ops.

## Display Flex - Grid
I started with `parent-elements` with `flex` and `grid` styles with `buttons` as `child-elements` and with `div -> buttons` to check the differences.

- `justify-items`, `justify-content`, `justify-self` and its behaviours
- `align-items`, `align-content`, `align-self` and its behaviours
